<h1> Seven Wonders Of The World</h1>

<br/>
    <p>In 2000 a Swiss foundation launched a campaign to determine the New Wonders of the World. <br>
    Given that the original Wonders list was compiled in the 2nd century BCE—and that only one <br>
    entrant is still standing (the Pyramids of Giza)—it seemed time for an update.And people <br>
    around the world apparently agreed, as more than 100 millionvotes were cast on the Internet<br>
     or by text messaging. The final results, which were announced in 2007, were met with cheers<br>
      as well as some jeers—a number of prominent contenders, such as Athens’s Acropolis, failed <br>to make the cut.<br/>

    <h3>1.Great Wall of China</h3>
    <img src="china.png" align="right" width="240" height="200">
    <p>
    Great might be an understatement. One of the world’s
     largest building-construction projects, the Great 
     Wall of China is <br/>widely thought to be about 
     5,500 miles (8,850 km) long; a disputed Chinese study, 
     however, claims the length is 13,170 miles (21,200 km).
      Work began in the 7th century BCE and continued for
       two millennia. Although called a “wall,” the structure 
       actually features two parallel walls for lengthy stretches.
       In addition, watchtowers and barracks dot the bulwark. 
       One not-so-great thing about the wall, however, was its 
       effectiveness. Although it was built to prevent invasions 
       and raids, the wall largely failed to provide actual security.
        Instead, scholars have noted that it served more as “political propaganda.”

        <h3>2.Chichen Itza</h3>
        <img src="itza.png" align="left" width="240" height="200">
        <p>
        Chichén Itzá is a Mayan city on the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico,
        which flourished in the 9th and 10th centuries CE. Under<br/> the Mayan
         tribe Itzá—who were strongly influenced by the Toltecs—a number 
         of important monuments and temples were built. Among the most 
         notable is the stepped pyramid El Castillo (“The Castle”), 
         which rises 79 feet (24 meters) above the Main <br/> Plaza. 
         A testament to the Mayans’ astronomical abilities, the 
         structure features a total of 365 steps, the number of 
         days in the </br> solar year. During the spring and autumnal 
         equinoxes, the setting sun casts shadows on the pyramid that 
         give the appearance of a serpent slithering down the north stairway;
         at the base is a stone snake head. Life there was not all work and 
          science, however. Chichén Itzá is home to the largest tlachtli 
          (a type of sporting field) in the Americas. On that field the residents
           played a ritual ball game popular throughout pre-Columbian Mesoamerica.

        <h3>3.Petra</h3>
        <img src="petra.png" align="right" width="240" height="200">
        <p>
        The ancient city of Petra, Jordan, is located in a remote valley, 
        nestled among sandstone mountains and cliffs. It was purported<br/> to 
        be one of the places where Moses struck a rock and water gushed forth. 
        Later the Nabataeans, an Arab tribe, made it their capital, and during 
        this time it flourished, becoming an important trade center, especially
        for spices. Noted carvers, the Nabataeans chiseled dwellings, temples,
        and tombs into the sandstone, which changed color with the shifting sun.
        In addition, they constructed a water system that allowed for lush 
        gardens and farming. At its height, Petra reportedly had a population 
        of 30,000. The city began to decline, however, as trade routes shifted. 
        A major earthquake in 363 CE caused more difficulty, and after another 
        tremor hit in 551, Petra was gradually abandoned. Although rediscovered 
        in 1912, it was largely ignored by archaeologists until the late 20th century, 
        and many questions remain about the city.

        <h3>4.Machu Picchu</h3>
        <img src="machu.png" align="left" width="240" height="200">
        <p>
        This Incan site near Cuzco, Peru, was “discovered” in 1911 by Hiram Bingham, 
        who believed it was Vilcabamba, a secret <br/> Incan stronghold used during the 
        16th-century rebellion against Spanish rule. Although that claim was later 
        disproved, the purpose of Machu Picchu has confounded scholars. Bingham 
        believed it was home to the “Virgins of the Sun,” women who lived in 
        convents under a vow of chastity. Others think that it was likely a pilgrimage
         site, while some believe it was a royal retreat. (One thing it apparently 
         should not be is the site of a beer commercial. In 2000 a crane being used 
         for such an ad fell and cracked a monument.) What is known is that Machu 
         Picchu is one of the few major pre-Columbian ruins found nearly intact. 
         Despite its relative isolation high in the Andes Mountains, it features
          agricultural terraces, plazas, residential areas, and temples.

        <h3>5.Christ The Redeemer </h3>
        <img src="christ.png" align="right" width="240" height="200">
        <p>
        Christ the Redeemer, a colossal statue of Jesus, stands atop Mount Corcovado
         in Rio de Janeiro. Its origins date to just <br/>after World War I, when some 
         Brazilians feared a “tide of godlessness.” They proposed a statue, which
          was ultimately designed <br/>by Heitor da Silva Costa, Carlos Oswald, and
           Paul Landowski. Construction began in 1926 and was completed five 
           years later.<br/> The resulting monument stands 98 feet (30 meters) 
           tall—not including its base, which is about 26 feet (8 meters) 
           high—and its outstretched arms span 92 feet (28 meters). It is the
            largest Art Deco sculpture in the world. Christ the Redeemer is 
            made of reinforced concrete and is covered in approximately six 
            million tiles. Somewhat disconcertingly, the statue has often been 
            struck <br/>by lightning, and in 2014 the tip of Jesus’s right thumb was
             damaged during a storm.

        <h3>6.Colloseum </h3>
        <img src="colosseum.png" align="left" width="240" height="200">
        <p>
        The Colosseum in Rome was built in the first century by order of the Emperor Vespasian.
         A feat of engineering, the <br/> amphitheater measures 620 by 513 feet (189 by 156 meters)
          and features a complex system of vaults. It was capable of holding 50,000 spectators,
           who watched a variety of events. Perhaps most notable were gladiator fights,
            though men battling animals was also common. In addition, water was sometimes
             pumped into the Colosseum for mock naval engagements. However, the belief 
             that Christians were martyred there—namely, by being thrown to lions—is debated. 
             According to some estimates, about 500,000 people died in the Colosseum. 
             Additionally, so many animals were captured and then killed there that certain 
             species reportedly became extinct.

        <h3>7.Taj Mahal </h3>
        <img src="taj.png" align="right" width="240" height="200">
        <p>
        This mausoleum complex in Agra, India, is regarded as one of the world’s most iconic
         monuments and is perhaps the finest example of Mughal architecture. It was built
          by Emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 1628–58) to honor his wife Mumtāz Maḥal <br/> (“Chosen One 
          of the Palace”), who died in 1631 giving birth to their 14th child. It took about
        22 years and 20,000 workers to construct the complex, which includes an immense
        garden with a reflecting pool. The mausoleum is made of white marble that 
        features semiprecious stones in geometric and floral patterns. Its majestic 
        central dome is surrounded by four smaller domes. According to some reports, 
        Shah Jahān wished to have his own mausoleum made out of black marble. However,
          he was deposed by one of his sons before any work began.
