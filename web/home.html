              <p>Various lists of the Wonders of the World have been compiled from antiquity 
                to the present day, in order to catalogue the
                 world's most spectacular natural features and human-built structures.
                The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World is the oldest known list of this
                 type, documenting the most remarkable man-made creations of classical 
                 antiquity; it was based on guidebooks popular among Hellenic sightseers 
                 and as such only includes works located around the Mediterranean rim 
                 and in the ancient Near East. The number seven was chosen because 
                 the Greeks believed it represented perfection and plenty, and 
                 because it reflected the number of planets known in ancient times 
                 (five) plus the Sun and Moon.</p> <br><br>
